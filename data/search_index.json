The challenges of monitoring cooking behaviour in refugee settlements", "authors": ["James Brusey"], "year": "2022", "abstract": "To address the need for improved access to energy and meet the United Nations Clean Energy Challenge (2019), humanitarian agencies require robust, valid, and meaningful data that documents the everyday energy practices of displaced people. Collecting data through sensor monitoring is one way of providing quality energy data that will aid humanitarian actors in designing and delivering sustainable affordable energy solutions. Using the case of the design and deployment of 20 stove use monitors (SUM) in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of collecting data on cookstove usage using wireless sensors in refugee settlements., Central to the discussion is the value of reflexivity or critical reflection to uncover significant knowledge gaps that can apply more generally to the problem of designing and deploying sensor systems for the displaced setting. If sensor monitoring systems are to collect data that aid appropriate energy planning and support technology development in the humanitarian sector, we contend improvements in sensor design and deployment protocols are needed to accommodate the displaced setting's cultural, economic, and political complexity. These improvements include the uptake of sensor monitoring design that embeds ethical, progressive, and inclusive protocols when working in the displaced setting.", "keywords": ["Cookstoves", " Humanitarian energy", " Data and evidence", " Sensors", " Socio-technical systems", " Internet of Things", " Monitoring"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/off-the-boil-the-challenges-of-monitoring-cooking-behaviour-in-re/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/james-brusey/"}, "pub_118": {"title": "Fast, detailed, accurate simulation of a thermal car-cabin using machine-learning", "authors": ["James Brusey"], "year": "2022", "abstract": "Car-cabin thermal systems, including heated seats, air-conditioning, and radiant panels, use a large proportion of the energy budget of electric vehicles and thus reduce their effective range. Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure.This fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control.", "keywords": ["electric vehicle", " thermal modeling", " time series prediction", " Artificial neural networks (ANN)", " NARX", " Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC)"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/fast-detailed-accurate-simulation-of-a-thermal-car-cabin-using-ma/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/james-brusey/"}, "pub_117": {"title": "Differential radial basis function network for sequence modelling", "authors": ["James Brusey"], "year": "2022", "abstract": "We propose a differential radial basis function (RBF) network termed RBF-DiffNet\u2014whose hidden layer blocks are partial differential equations (PDEs) linear in terms of the RBF\u2014to make the baseline RBF network robust to noise in sequential data. Assuming that the sequential data derives from the discretisation of the solution to an underlying PDE, the differential RBF network learns constant linear coefficients of the PDE, consequently regularising the RBF network by following modified backward-Euler updates. We experimentally validate the differential RBF network on the logistic map chaotic timeseries as well as on 30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition. The proposed model is compared with the normalised and unnormalised RBF networks, ARIMA, and ensembles of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks. From the experimental results, RBF-DiffNet consistently shows a marked reduction in the prediction error over the baseline RBF network (e.g., 41% reduction in the root mean squared scaled error on the M5 dataset, and 53% reduction in the mean absolute error on the logistic map); RBF-DiffNet also shows a comparable performance to the LSTM ensemble but requires 99% less computational time.

However, most of the previous studies focused on the development of theoretical models and practical strategies that scholars can employ to attract diverse populations to their citizen science (CS) projects. Their findings were mostly based on either conceptual ethical frameworks or empirical observations of the scholars after the completion of the specific CS project. Few studies collected socio-demographic and behavioral data of the active citizens involved in a CS project to analyze the diversity of citizens in CS.  However, to the best of our knowledge, having reviewed numerous peer-reviewed papers, none of the previous studies attempted to use prospective citizen scientists\u2019 traits to investigate intrinsic factors that may help increase the active engagement and diversity in CS. This paper presents a new inclusive citizen science engagement model based on quantitative analysis of surveys administered to 540 participants of the dedicated free informal education course \u2018Your Right to Privacy Online\u2019 (MOOC - a massive online open course) from eight countries in the EU funded project, CSI-COP (Citizen Scientists Investigating Cookies and App GDPR compliance). The surveys were filled out just after completing the training stage and before joining the project as active citizen scientists. Out of the 540 participants who completed the surveys analyzed in this study, only 170 (32%) individuals actively participated as citizen scientists in the project. Therefore, the study attempted to understand what characterizes these participants compared to those who decided to refrain from joining the project after the training stage. This study\u2019s findings revealed several important relationships and predictors for becoming a citizen scientist based on the surveys analysis, such as age, gender, culture, education, Internet accessibility and apps usage, as well as the satisfaction with the MOOC, the mode of training and initial intentions for becoming a citizen scientist. These findings lead to the development of the empirical model for inclusive engagement in CS and enhance the understanding of the internal factors that influence individuals' intention and actual participation as citizen scientists. The devised model offers valuable insights for designing inclusive recruitment strategies, fostering positive learning experiences, addressing technological barriers, bridging the intention-engagement gap, and tailoring engagement strategies to accommodate ethnic and cultural diversity.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", " Citizen participation", " Citizen engagement", " GDPR", " informed consent"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/modeling-intrinsic-factors-of-inclusive-engagement-in-citizen-sci/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/huma-shah/"}, "pub_97": {"title": "Editorial: Women in language and computation 2022", "authors": ["Huma Shah"], "year": "2023", "abstract": "", "keywords": ["linguist", " language", " women in STEM", " Computer science", " Artificial Intelligence"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/editorial-women-in-language-and-computation-2022/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/huma-shah/"}, "pub_96": {"title": "Beneath the bonnet of online privacy: Monitoring GDPR compliance through citizen science", "authors": ["Huma Shah"], "year": "2023", "abstract": "The GDPR regulation was designed to give internet users a greater degree of control over their personal data, yet not all websites and apps are fully compliant and many still have trackers embedded.

This study examines the alteration of brain activity caused by dementia by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an infor- mation geometry method known as information rate, which captures the evolving pat- terns of brain signals over time rather than relying on static averages. This method is applied across standard EEG frequency bands \u2013 delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma\u2013 in participants with dementia and healthy controls. The characteristics of the distribu- tion of information rate are studied through the statistical moments (such as mean, vari- ance, skewness, and kurtosis) and Shannon entropy. The statistical comparisons are accessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s post-hoc analysis, and results are compared against a conventional average-base method using Jensen-Shannon distance. The results show that dynamic features of EEG signals \u2013 particularly in the theta, alpha, and beta bands \u2013 effectively distinguish Alzheimer\u2019s patients from healthy individuals, while the Shannon entropy of signal dynamics in frontal region differentiates frontotem- poral dementia patients across the theta to gamma bands. Moreover, changes in the occipital region detected by information rate, but not by traditional method, further high- light the importance of capturing temporal variability. The method also successfully dis- tinguishes individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy controls, which con- ventional analysis failed to achieve.

The integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with epidemiological models offers a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and developing effective strategies to control and mitigate their impact. In this study, we develop a novel hybrid approach to modelling and forecasting the dynamics and the demand for healthcare resources. We take advantage of the concept of PINNs to capture the dynamics of infectious diseases, estimate key parameters, and unobserved states in the ability of the model, using the neural network to integrate physical laws directly into the learning process of a modified compartmental model. We also make use of the strength of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine data generated by a PINN and lagged covariates of target variables to forecast demand from the intensive care unit demand using different variations of RNN models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid framework is highly effective in capturing the dynamics of the pandemic and providing insight into the dynamics of the disease.", "keywords": [""], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-hybrid-physics-informed-neural-network-seird-model-for-forecast/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/fei-he/"}, "pub_79": {"title": "Reinforcement Learning for Building Control: Direct Actuator or PID-Mediated Control?", "authors": ["James Brusey"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "Building control systems typically use either setpoint regulation, where controllers determine optimal setpoints for low-level systems, or direct actuator control, which bypasses the setpoint layer. Despite widespread hierarchical approaches, empirical evidence comparing these strategies remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both paradigms using reinforcement learning (RL) with the Building Optimization Performance Test (BOPTEST) framework. We implement and compare: (1) setpoint-trained RL agents using PPO, DQN, and A2C algorithms, (2) direct actuation-controlled RL agents with identical algorithms, and (3) a conventional PI controller baseline. Experiments span two simulation environments (BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump and BESTEST Air systems) with constant electricity pricing. Results demonstrate that setpoint regulation achieves near-perfect thermal comfort (> 99% discomfort reduction) with modest energy cost increases (4.8\u20135.0%), while direct actuator control offers smaller energy penalties (1.8\u20133.2%) with substantial comfort improvements (> 80% discomfort reduction). Most significantly, setpoint regulation consistently demonstrated faster learning, requiring 48\u201379% fewer training steps across algorithms and environments. The setpoint-trained approach also exhibited 38% lower control signal variance (measured as the standard deviation of actuator commands) over the 14-day testing period. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting a two-level control architecture, where an RL agent optimizes setpoints for existing low-level controllers, while also identifying conditions where direct actuator control by an RL agent may be advantageous. Our research contributes valuable empirical insights for designing energy-efficient building control strategies using reinforcement learning, with setpoint regulation offering significant advantages in training efficiency and control stability.", "keywords": [""], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/reinforcement-learning-for-building-control-direct-actuator-or-pi/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/james-brusey/"}, "pub_78": {"title": "Learning from less: SINDy Surrogates in RL", "authors": ["James Brusey"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "This paper presents a method to create simpler versions of reinforcement learning (RL) environments using the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm.

de-carbonisation and increase equity of energy systems among displaced communities. However, micro-grid solutions are often inflexible and lack functionality to respond to displaced community energy needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions. This paper explores the use of fog-computing retrofit architectures deployed on community micro-grid infrastructures to enable flexible demand management to improve service delivery and longevity. A micro-services solution is proposed that decouples components increasing resilience and testability while allowing hybrid edge-cloud deployments. The architecture is outlined and demonstrated for a micro-grid providing energy to two nurseries and a playground in Kigeme refugee camp, Rwanda. To enact the community priorities within the demand management system, modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods are outlined and tested for different use-case scenarios. The performance of the modified GA methods are then compared with a pre-existing battery protect controller and an alternative deterministic (space-shared) energy manager model. A modified search space GA method was required for GA to outperform both the existing battery controller and proposed deterministic method in terms of achieving the highest utility function in almost every use-case. The results further showed how simple community priorities can be set and used to enact control on the system in 24h timeframes that are in line with the local decision-making context.", "keywords": ["Smart microgrid", " Community energy management system", " Cyber-physical systems", " Edge computing", " Internet of things", " Displaced communities"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-community-energy-management-system-for-smart-microgrids/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elena-gaura/"}, "pub_58": {"title": "The funding calls needed to advance the implementation of Smart Local Energy Systems.", "authors": ["Elena Gaura"], "year": "2023", "abstract": "This paper is the outcome of a workshop delivered as part of the Energy Revolution Research Consortium (EnergyREV) \u2018Energy Smart Places: Insights from research and the challenges ahead\u2019 summit held in March 2023, in London.

Our analysis, using an integrated assessment model, shows a large gap in regional efforts toward global net-zero emissions, stemming from the necessary shift of energy systems to low-carbon resources. The use of new technologies, like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture, varies by region, with the highest adoption required between 2020 and 2030.

research report draws on original research to explore how care-experienced children and young people from minoritised backgrounds understand their identities. Through their narratives, we understand how children in care experience and perceive their identities, as well as their understandings of the care that they receive and desire for their identities.We rely on children\u2019s and young people\u2019s voices and stories. Using an intersectional approach, we worked with Black, Asian and mixed-heritage children and young people (aged 14 to 19) to understand their narratives of identity. We focused firstly on understandings of ethnicity and religion and how these change in relation to other aspects of identity and, crucially, by being in care. Secondly, we examined their experiences of asking and getting help from social workers, foster carers, adopters and other support structures that provide for their identities while in care.By listening to and understanding children and young people\u2019s perspectives around ethnicity, religion and identity, we developed a new framework to inform both theoretical and practical work with children in care. We describe our model as Identities in-Flux, which integrates Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s Intersectionality and Meredith McGuires\u2019 Lived Religion theories to generate new frameworks of reference that support best practice when implementing support plans for young people and children. Within this model, we consider the interplay of changing socio-ethnic-religious factors, as well as young people and children\u2019s biological heritage, their being in care and their own agency in determining how they themselves want to be perceived. By broadening discussion from a singular focus on one aspect of identity, such as race or gender, we hope to support inclusive and sensitive practices and policies that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of children and young people entering care.", "keywords": ["Children", " care", " Race", " Religion", " Politics of Care"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/expressions-of-self-race-religion-and-representation-of-minoritis/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/alison-halford/"}, "pub_15": {"title": "A Lifecycle Approach for Artificial Intelligence Ethics in Energy Systems", "authors": ["Alison Halford"], "year": "2024", "abstract": "Despite the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, the practical application of these frameworks in industrial settings remains limited. This limitation is further augmented in energy systems by the complexity of systems composition and systems operation for energy generation, distribution, and supply. The primary reason for this limitation is the gap between the conceptual notion of ethics principles and the technical performance of AI applications in energy systems. For instance, trust is featured prominently in ethics frameworks but pertains to limited relevance for the robust operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we propose a lifecycle approach for AI ethics that aims to address this gap. The proposed approach consists of four phases: design, development, operation, and evaluation. All four phases are supported by a central AI ethics repository that gathers and integrates the primary and secondary dimensions of ethical practice, including reliability, safety, and trustworthiness, from design through to evaluation. This lifecycle approach is closely aligned with the operational lifecycle of energy systems, from design and production through to use, maintenance, repair, and overhaul, followed by shutdown, recycling, and replacement. Across these lifecycle stages, an energy system engages with numerous human stakeholders, directly with designers, engineers, users, trainers, operators, and maintenance technicians, as well as indirectly with managers, owners, policymakers, and community groups. This lifecycle approach is empirically evaluated in the complex energy system of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where the alignment between ethics and technical performance, as well as the human-centric application of AI, are demonstrated.", "keywords": ["AI ethics", " responsible AI", " energy AI", " AI risks", " AI lifecycle", " energy systems", " implementation science"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-lifecycle-approach-for-artificial-intelligence-ethics-in-energy/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/alison-halford/"}, "pub_14": {"title": "[Review of] Irish Mormonism: Reconciling Identity in Global Mormonism, by HAZEL O\u2019BRIEN", "authors": ["Alison Halford"], "year": "2024", "abstract": "Review of Irish Mormonism: Reconciling Identity in Global Mormonism, by HAZEL O\u2019BRIEN Get access ArrowIrish Mormonism: Reconciling Identity in Global Mormonism, by HAZEL O\u2019BRIENChicago:  University of Illinois Press,  2023,  209 pp.; $26.00.", "keywords": [""], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/review-of-irish-mormonism-reconciling-identity-in-global-mormonis/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/alison-halford/"}, "pub_13": {"title": "\u201cYour Lord has not forsaken you\u201d: Interrogating Socio-Political and Theological Reasons for the lack of Adopters and Foster Carers from Muslim backgrounds in Britain", "authors": ["Alison Halford"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "All children need permanent, caring and secure homes in which they can grow and thrive.

This research addresses how the distributed generation location and capacity impact the operation of the circuit breaker in terms of the response time of the circuit breakers. The relative electrical distances of the faults and distributed generation to the circuit breakers are considered. The impact of distributed generation capacity considering the fault location is characterized using a new index called the heterogeneity index. The electrical distance between distributed generations and circuit breakers and the electrical distance between fault and circuit breaker is considered by a second new index called the electrical distance ratio. Data analysis on simulation results shows that these indices capture the phenomena of protection blinding caused by distributed generation. Results show that a higher distributed generation penetration and faults that are electrically further away from a circuit breaker show severe cases of protection blinding captured by the indices. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these indices can identify the worst impacted locations in the distribution grid. A key result is that protection blinding does not necessarily occur solely due to the presence of distributed generation between a circuit breaker and a fault, but is dependent on factors such as distributed generation location in the distribution grid, fault level, fault level distribution across the generation units and fault\u00a0location.", "keywords": ["distributed power generation", " power system protection"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/analysis-of-protection-blinding-in-active-distribution-grids/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdorasoul-ghasemi/"}, "pub_3": {"title": "Swarm Intelligence-Based Algorithm for Workload Placement in Edge-Fog-Cloud Continuum", "authors": ["Abdorasoul Ghasemi"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "This paper addresses the workload placement problem in the edge-fog-cloud continuum. We model the edge fog-cloud computing continuum as a multi-agent framework consisting of networked resource supply and demand agents. Inspired by the swarm intelligence behavior of the ant colony optimization, we propose a workload scheduler for the arriving demand agents to increase local resource utilization and reduce communication costs without relying on a centralized scheduler. Like the ants, the demand agents will release pheromones on the resource agent to indicate the available resources. The next arriving demand agent will most probably choose a neighbor, following the pheromone value and communication cost. The framework\u2019s performance is evaluated in terms of local resource utilization, dependency on fog and cloud, and communication cost. We compare these metrics for the ant-inspired algorithm with random and greedy algorithms.The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm inspired by swarm intelligence can increase resource utilization at the edge and reduce the dependency on higher layers, while also decreasing the communication cost for the task of resource allocation", "keywords": ["Swarm Intelligence", " Edge-Fog-Cloud Continuum", " Ant Colony Optimization."], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/swarm-intelligence-based-algorithm-for-workload-placement-in-edge/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdorasoul-ghasemi/"}, "pub_2": {"title": "Optimal Redundant Sensor Placement for Protection Blinding in Active Distribution Grids", "authors": ["Abdorasoul Ghasemi"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources into the power distribution grid challenges protection system operation, leading to protection blinding when circuit breakers fail to trip due to fault current contribution from these sources. Communication-based adaptive protection can address this issue, but communication system components like sensors can fail. This research proposes a genetic algorithm-based approach to optimally place redundant sensors, minimizing protection blinding under communication uncertainty within a redundancy budget. The fault tolerance, measured by a new metric called redundancy degree, reflects the number of redundant components deployed. Results demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness in optimizing redundant sensor locations, reducing system costs, and improving fault tolerance. For the system and scenarios investigated, an average of 60% redundant sensors are relocated, reducing the average protection trip time by 36.65% compared to a baseline approach that does not consider communication uncertainty. This encourages incorporating communication component failure considerations in power system planning.", "keywords": ["Genetic algorithm", " redundancy", " uncertainty", " adaptive protection"], "publication_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/optimal-redundant-sensor-placement-for-protection-blinding-in-act/", "profile_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdorasoul-ghasemi/"}, "pub_1": {"title": "A community\u2011based entropic method to identify influential nodes across multiple social networks", "authors": ["Abdorasoul Ghasemi"], "year": "2025", "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in social networks \u2212 by determining the most effective and efficient set of primary users \u2212 is acrucial task for maximizing the spread of influence. The competitive world of social networks and the variety of servicesthey provide have persuaded users to apply for the membership of several networks. This situation makes involvement ofthe shared individuals across multiple social networks essential for the effective dissemination of information. In this paper,we introduce a community-based entropic method to identify influential nodes in multiple social networks, taking intoaccount the effect of shared users. The proposed method, titled IM2-SE, focuses on calculating a total structural entropy foreach node. This structural entropy is defined as the weighted sum of the structural entropies of the node in the networks andin the communities, it belongs to. The structural entropy of a node is based on Tsallis entropy considering both local andglobal structures of the network, and it utilizes the degree of centrality and betweenness centrality. Then, the nodes with thehighest total structural entropy are identified as the influential nodes. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method onthe real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrates its superior performance to thebaseline methods. Furthermore, the impact of the shared nodes between networks in identifying the influential nodes hasbeen examined, revealing that up to 50% of the identified influential nodes are the shared nodes between specific networks.", "keywords": ["Influence Maximization", " Influential Nodes", " Multiple Social Networks", " Community Detection", " Structural Entropy", " Tsallis Entropy"],
